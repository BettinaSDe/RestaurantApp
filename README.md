#### _Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

Specs: This **Restaurant Reviews** project is a training how to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. The static design that lacks accessibility has to be converted to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I have also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.


1. The local server I was running is: `http://localhost:5050` with python.
